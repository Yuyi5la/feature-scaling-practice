Feature Scaling & Encoding in Machine Learning
Project Overview
This project is part of my journey in learning data preprocessing techniques in machine learning. The focus is on feature scaling and converting non-numeric data into numeric formats to improve model performance.

What I Learned
Feature Scaling: Standardization (Z-score normalization), Min-Max scaling, and mean normalization.
Encoding Categorical Variables: Label encoding, one-hot encoding, and ordinal encoding.
Practical Application: Using Python libraries like pandas and scikit-learn to preprocess datasets.
Technologies Used
